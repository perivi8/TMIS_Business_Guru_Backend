## Implementation Details

### How It Works
1. When a client's optional mobile number is updated in the edit-client page:
   - The system detects the change in the `optional_mobile_number` field
   - A WhatsApp message is automatically generated and sent to the primary mobile number
   - The message informs the client that their alternate mobile number has been added

2. The message template used:
   ```
   Hii {legal_name} sir/madam, 

   Your alternate mobile number ({optional_mobile_number}) was added successfully . 

   Thank you for keeping your information up to date with us!
   ```

### Code Implementation
The functionality is implemented in:
- `client_whatsapp_service.py` - `send_multiple_client_update_messages()` function
- `client_routes.py` - Client update handling with WhatsApp notification logic

### Key Features
- ✅ Messages are sent to the primary mobile number only
- ✅ Only sends message when there's actually a new optional mobile number
- ✅ Prevents duplicate messages for the same optional mobile number
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Network timeout handling

## Verification
The test confirms that:
1. ✅ WhatsApp service is properly configured and available
2. ✅ Messages are sent successfully to the primary mobile number
3. ✅ Correct message content is generated
4. ✅ No errors occur during message sending
5. ✅ Both full flow and direct message sending work correctly

## Conclusion
The WhatsApp message functionality for optional mobile number updates is working correctly. When users edit client information and change the optional mobile number:
- A notification is immediately sent to the client's primary mobile number
- The client is informed that their alternate mobile number has been added
- The system handles all edge cases properly (network issues, duplicate numbers, etc.)

This functionality provides immediate feedback to clients when their information is updated, improving user experience and communication.
